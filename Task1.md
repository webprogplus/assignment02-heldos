# Setting up

- Create a new folder in the current projects & call it **css**. In the **css** folder, create a file called **main-01.css**.
Link **main-01.css** to **chartreuse-06.html**, **index-03.html**, & **tertiary-02.html**
- Review the slides we have covered in the last lecture as well as the content provided at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)

# Specific CSS

  - Read [EM, PX, PT, CM, IN](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.de.html#units)
  - The **figures** in **chartreuse-06.html** are too close together. Insert a **margin** under each one that is **2.5em** in size.
  - Make every **nav** have a background color of yellow & a font of Verdana, a sans-serif font.
  - Make every **article** have a background color of **pink** & a font of **Georgia**, a serif font.
  - Make every **aside** have a background color of **silver** & a font of **Courier** (if you use a Mac) or Courier New (if you use Windows), a monospace font.
  - Make every **footer** have a background color of **yellow** & a font of **Verdana**, a sans-serif font.

# On index-03.html:

  - the words “Cras justo odio” are alerts that need to be red & bold, so use CSS to style them accordingly.
  - all instances of **h3** inside **a** (anchor) elements (& only h3s that are inside as) need to have a bottom border that is **1px** in width, **dotted**, & has a color of **red**.
