# Task3

- Create a new folder named **colostomo-home-page**.
- Reproduce this webpage [Colostomo Inc. Home Page](Colostomo-Inc.pdf). Ignore the large white margin around the edge of the PDF — your version of the Colostomo Inc. Home Page should go right to the edge of the browser’s viewport, i.e. use the total width.

- The **<title>** of the webpage is: Colostomo Inc.

## How to make a block go all the way to the edge of the viewport (or any container):
  - Set a **margin** to a negative value (e.g., -1em)
  - Set the padding to a positive value equal to the negative value (e.g., 1em)

- To find out the colors, use a color picker (e.g. for Windows you can use the Color Picker from PowerToys • Free!).

## Use a font stack with 3 fonts:
  - Read [https://kulturbanause.de/faq/font-stack/](https://kulturbanause.de/faq/font-stack/) first to find out what a font stack is
  - The first font should come from the collection at Google Fonts, but loaded from a fonts folder in your new colostomo-home-page project. To locally load Google Fonts, use the technique outlined at [Serving Google Fonts From Your Own Server](https://www.granneman.com/webdev/coding/css/fonts-and-formatting/serving-google-fonts-your-own-server-correctly/), Correctly.
  - The second font should be a common font found on most computers - Microsoft’s Core Fonts for the Web [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_fonts_for_the_Web)
  - The third font should be a generic font family.

- For font sizing, use the method that is discussed in the font-size section of CSS - Typography by Scott Granneman:
  - [slides PDF](https://granneman.com/downloads/web-dev/CSS-Typography.pdf) & px, then rem, then em—in the right locations. Browse through the slides to get an overview!
