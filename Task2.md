# Task2

## Do the following:
  - duplicate **chartreuse-06.html** & rename it to **chartreuse-07.html**
  - duplicate **main-01.css** & rename it to **main-02.css**
  - create a folder named fonts in your project
Youâ€™re going to improve **chartreuse-07.html** by choosing better fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the text on that page & embedding them in **main-02.css**.
    - Pick a nice serif font for the header.
    - Pick a nice sans-serif font for the body.
To embed those fonts, use one method as outlined in [Google Fonts einbinden - HowTo](https://wiki.selfhtml.org/wiki/HTML/Tutorials/Google-Fonts_einbinden).
Be creative in your choice of fonts, but also make sure that the text is readable & attractive.
